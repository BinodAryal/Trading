# Machine Learning For Trading


### Introduction

The use of algorithms to make trading decisions has become a predominant practice in major stock exchanges of the world. Algorithmic trading, also called as high-frequency trading, is the use of automated systems to identify true signals among massive amounts of data that capture the underlying stock market dynamics. Machine Learning has therefore been central to the process of algorithmic trading because it provides powerful tools to extract patterns from the seemingly disorganized market trends.

This project, in particular, learns models from Yahoo stock data to predict stock/Forex price changes and aims to make profit over time.
